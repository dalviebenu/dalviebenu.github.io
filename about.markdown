I was born in India but raised in many different countries. This include the United States, South Africa, Sweden and I am currently in the
netherlands. I have a passion for technology and I am always looking for new ways to learn and grow. I am currently a student at the
Vrije University and University of Amsterdam (Joint Degree) studying MSc of Computer Science.

In my free time I like to do brasillian jiu jitsu, play video games, read books and paint.
